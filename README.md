This repository contains projects from the freeCodeCamp **"Machine Learning with Python"** course. Each project applies key machine learning concepts using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.

## Projects Included

- **Image Classifier** – A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras for image classification.  
- **Recommendation Engine** – A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based system for personalized book recommendations.  
- **Regression Model** – A predictive model, for calculating health costs, developed using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
